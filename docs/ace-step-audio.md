# ModusFlow ACE Step Audio 1.5

An enhanced `TextEncodeAceStepAudio1.5` node with song save/load functionality, modelled after the ModusFlow Text Editor. Write your tags and lyrics once, save them by name, and recall them instantly in future sessions.

---

## Overview

This node is a drop-in replacement for ComfyUI's built-in `TextEncodeAceStepAudio1.5`. It adds a **Title** field and save/load controls:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **💾 Save Song** | Saves current title + tags + lyrics to `saved_prompts/songs/<title>.json` (uses title as filename; prompts if title is empty) |
| **✏️ Update Song** | Overwrites the file currently shown in the dropdown with the current content |
| **🔄 Refresh All** | Re-reads `saved_prompts/songs/` (with fallback to root `saved_prompts/` and legacy `saved_songs/`) and repopulates dropdowns |

Selecting a file from the **Saved Song** dropdown automatically loads the title, tags, and lyrics into the node.

The **title** is also passed through as a STRING output so it can be used as `%title%` in the ModusFlow Save Audio filename prefix.

## Song File Format

Songs are saved as JSON files in `ComfyUI-ModusFlow/saved_songs/` (configurable via `songs_save_directory` in `config.json`):

```json
{
  "title": "Fly Away",
  "tags": "pop, upbeat, electric guitar, female vocals",
  "lyrics": "[verse1]\nWaking up to a brand new day\n\n[chorus]\nFly away, fly away..."
}
```

## Usage Tips

- Use `[verse]`, `[chorus]`, `[bridge]`, `[outro]` markers in lyrics for structure.
- Tags drive the overall genre and instrumentation — keep them concise and comma-separated.
- Disable `generate_audio_codes` if you are providing a reference audio (faster generation).
- Save each song variant with a descriptive name so you can A/B different lyrics or styles.

## Troubleshooting

**Dropdown shows "--no songs found--"**
No `.json` files exist yet in the `saved_songs` folder. Click **💾 Save Song** to create your first one.

**Saved song not appearing after saving**
Click **🔄 Refresh List** to reload the dropdown from disk.

**Node outputs wrong conditioning**
Make sure the connected CLIP model is an ACE Step 1.5 CLIP — using a regular CLIP will error.
